This single-page application uses Highcharts with data from Yahoo! Finance to display recent stock market data. Stocks can be added or removed by users, and, using WebSockets, these changes are synced to all other users.

This project is a part of [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com/)'s curriculum.
